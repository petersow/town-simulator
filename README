A ruby library to simulate a town.

Requires ruby 1.9.2

--- SPEC FAIL. MIGHT NOT FIX --
 
Run rspec spec to check everythings working on your machine.

Run ./bin/town to run example use of library.

Or to install the library as a gem for use with other projects do the following

rake install

After install running "town" on your box should start the example run.
This is largely for debugging. See the king-sim project for a more visual experiance.
